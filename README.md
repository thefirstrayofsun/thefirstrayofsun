# My Portfolio


Always "buzzing with thoughts" curious eclectic writer, who further articulates her thoughts into string of words. I like to stay updated on trends and am equipped with extensive experience in writing buzz-worthy content.
I'm right on my toes in order to plunge head first into the sea to trade the waves of skill sets and talents.
The aim is to pierce through the thick fog of life and eventually reach the destination with big toothy grin.
